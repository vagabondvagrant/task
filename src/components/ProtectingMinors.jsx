      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Keep your username, password, and deposit details out of reach. Like, not written down on a post-it stuck to your laptop.</li>
        <li>Donâ€™t save passwords or use auto-fill on your computer.</li>
        <li>If there are kids around, always log out of your Betfair account.</li>
        <li>Install website blocking software, such as NetNanny, which allows you to control and block access to gambling websites both on PC and mobile.</li>
        <li>Educate your kids about the legality and potential damage of underage gambling.</li>
        <li>Limit the amount of time your children spend online.</li>
        <li>Familiarize yourself with the built-in parental tools on your Mobile/Tablet/PC/TV devices.</li>
        <li>If you feel you may have an issue with underage gambling or you just want to learn more, BigDeal, run by GamCare, is an organization aimed at young people that offers education and support about gambling.</li>
