      </p>
        <div className='text-center mt-2'>
        &bull; They’re obsessed with gambling, talking about it all the time, or constantly checking the betting apps on their phone.
        <br />
        &bull; They’re betting larger amounts or more frequently.
        <br />
        &bull; They’ve missed work, college, or uni because of gambling.
        <br />
        &bull; They’re using betting as an escape and are being secretive about their betting.
        <br />
        &bull; They’ve asked to be bailed out if they’ve lost a bet or multiple bets.

        If you notice some of the signs above in a friend or family member, what can you do?

        <span className="block mb-2">
          1. SPEAK UP: Maybe you’re not the best person to mention it to them, but you probably do know the person best placed to say it.
        </span>
        <br />
        <span className="block mb-2">
          2. GET THE TEAM TOGETHER: Often it helps if it’s two or three people, so that they can see it’s not just one person’s opinion. No matter who or how, ultimately the person in question will understand that you’re trying to look out for their best interests.

          3. SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE: If you need to show them proof, you can start by showing them our list above. Then you can share the tools and organisations they can turn to for support – you’ll be able to find these under “Where to go”
